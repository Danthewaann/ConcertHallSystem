### ConcertHallSystem
GUI application that manages concerts, along with their customers and seats.

If you want to download the program to try it out, do the following:

1. Go to the "dist" folder inside the main directory.
2. Download the jar file.
3. Create a folder for the jar and place it in that (Makes life easier).
4. Enjoy!

This was a university assignment that I did, and since then I have been playing around with since late November 2016, I will probably still make some changes, so that's why it's here.

### Possible upcoming changes:

1. ~~Completely revamp GUI by decomposing MainGUI class into smaller classes for each UI component.~~ 
2. ~~Switch over from Swing to JavaFX for a more up-to-date UI look and feel.~~
3. ~~Create new exception classes, mainly SeatIOException and CustomerIOException.~~
4. Re-do file save and load operations, so one concert can save itself without having to save all other concerts as well.
