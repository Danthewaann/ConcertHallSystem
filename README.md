This project has been finished

##### Barring some slight revisions I may do in the future

## Java/JavaFX versions
Java 11.0.10  
JavaFX 15.0.1

## The ConcertHallSystem
GUI application that manages concerts, along with their customers and seats.

If you want to download the program to try it out, do the following:

1. Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
2. Run `mvn package` to compile code and create jar file.
4. Run `concerthallsystem-<version>.jar` file.

This was a university assignment that I did, and since then I have been playing around with since late November 2016, I will probably still make some changes, so that's why it's here.

### Possible upcoming changes:

1. ~~Completely revamp GUI by decomposing MainGUI class into smaller classes for each UI component.~~ 
2. ~~Switch over from Swing to JavaFX for a more up-to-date UI look and feel.~~
3. ~~Create new exception classes, mainly SeatIOException and CustomerIOException.~~
4. ~~Re-do file save and load operations, so one concert can save itself without having to save all other concerts as well.~~
